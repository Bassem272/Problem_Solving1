An extension method in C# is a static method that allows you to add new methods to existing types without modifying their source code. It provides a way to extend the functionality of classes, including those for which you don't have access to the source code. Extension methods are defined in static classes and are a powerful feature that enhances code readability and maintainability.

Here are key points about extension methods:

1. **Static Method in a Static Class:**
   - An extension method is a static method defined in a static class.

2. **Marked with `this` Keyword:**
   - The first parameter of an extension method must be prefixed with the `this` keyword, indicating the type being extended. This parameter represents the instance on which the method is called.

3. **Usage with Existing Types:**
   - Extension methods can be called as if they were instance methods on the extended type, even though they are defined in a separate static class.

4. **No Modification of Original Code:**
   - One of the primary benefits of extension methods is that they allow you to extend the functionality of existing types without modifying their source code.

5. **Namespace:**
   - The static class containing extension methods must be in scope through either the `using` directive or fully qualified names.

Here's an example of an extension method:

```csharp
using System;

public static class StringExtensions
{
    // Extension method for string type
    public static string Repeat(this string str, int count)
    {
        return new string('*', count).Replace("*", str);
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string repeatedString = "Hello".Repeat(3);
        Console.WriteLine(repeatedString);  // Outputs: HelloHelloHello
    }
}
```

In this example:
- `StringExtensions` is a static class containing an extension method named `Repeat`.
- The first parameter of the `Repeat` method is prefixed with `this string str`, indicating that it extends the `string` type.
- The method can be called as if it were an instance method on any string (`"Hello".Repeat(3)`).
- Extension methods provide a clean and readable way to add functionality to existing types without cluttering their interfaces or modifying their source code.

A static class in C# is a class that cannot be instantiated and is designed to provide a container for static members (methods, properties, fields) that are not associated with instance members of an object. All members of a static class must be static.

Here are key characteristics of a static class:

1. **Cannot be Instantiated:**
   - A static class cannot be instantiated using the `new` keyword, and you cannot create instances of it. It's intended to be used as a container for static members.

2. **Static Members:**
   - All members (methods, properties, fields) of a static class must be static. They are associated with the class itself rather than instances of the class.

3. **Cannot Inherit or be Inherited:**
   - A static class cannot inherit from another class, and it cannot be inherited by other classes.

4. **Cannot Contain Instance Members:**
   - Static classes cannot contain instance members (non-static members). They are limited to static members only.

Here's an example of a static class and a static method:

```csharp
public static class MathUtility
{
    public static int Add(int a, int b)
    {
        return a + b;
    }

    public static int Multiply(int a, int b)
    {
        return a * b;
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Static methods are called directly on the class, not on instances
        int sum = MathUtility.Add(5, 3);
        int product = MathUtility.Multiply(4, 2);

        Console.WriteLine("Sum: " + sum);        // Outputs: Sum: 8
        Console.WriteLine("Product: " + product); // Outputs: Product: 8
    }
}
```

In this example:
- `MathUtility` is a static class.
- The `Add` and `Multiply` methods are static methods within the static class.
- They can be called directly on the class itself (`MathUtility.Add`) without creating an instance.

Static methods are often used for utility functions that don't depend on the state of an object. They are associated with the class rather than an instance and can be called without creating an instance of the class.

Not necessarily. An extension method is a special kind of static method in C#, but it's not inherited from a parent class. Instead, it's a static method that is defined in a static class and is meant to be used to extend the functionality of existing types, including types you don't have control over.

Here are the key points about extension methods:

1. **Static Method in a Static Class:**
   - An extension method is a static method defined in a static class.

2. **No Inheritance:**
   - Unlike regular static methods, extension methods don't need to be called directly on the class where they are defined. Instead, they are called as if they were instance methods on the extended type.

3. **Extension Methods Extend Existing Types:**
   - Extension methods are used to extend the functionality of existing types without modifying their source code. They allow you to add new methods to existing types.

Here's a simple example of an extension method for the `string` type:

```csharp
public static class StringExtensions
{
    public static string Repeat(this string str, int count)
    {
        return new StringBuilder().Insert(0, str, count).ToString();
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string repeatedString = "Hello".Repeat(3);
        Console.WriteLine(repeatedString);  // Outputs: HelloHelloHello
    }
}
```

In this example:
- The `Repeat` method is defined in the `StringExtensions` static class.
- It takes a `string` (the extended type) as its first parameter (`this string str`) and an additional parameter (`int count`).
- The method can be called as if it were an instance method on any string.

Extension methods are a way to provide additional functionality to existing types in a clean and readable manner without modifying their source code. They are not inherited but are instead called directly on instances of the extended types.

Let's clarify the concepts of instance methods and extension methods:

1. **Instance Method:**
   - An instance method is a method that operates on an instance of a class or an object. It is associated with an instance of a class and can access the instance's properties and other non-static members.
   - Example:

     ```csharp
     public class MyClass
     {
         public void InstanceMethod()
         {
             // This is an instance method
             Console.WriteLine("This is an instance method.");
         }
     }

     // Usage
     MyClass myObject = new MyClass();
     myObject.InstanceMethod(); // Call the instance method on an instance of MyClass
     ```

2. **Extension Method:**
   - An extension method is a special kind of static method that allows you to add new methods to existing types without modifying their source code. It's defined in a static class, and its first parameter is prefixed with the `this` keyword, indicating the type being extended.
   - Extension methods are called as if they were instance methods on the extended type, providing a syntactic sugar for adding functionality to existing types.
   - Example:

     ```csharp
     public static class StringExtensions
     {
         public static string Repeat(this string str, int count)
         {
             // This is an extension method
             return new string('*', count).Replace("*", str);
         }
     }

     // Usage
     string repeatedString = "Hello".Repeat(3); // Call the extension method on a string
     ```

   - In the example, `Repeat` is an extension method for the `string` type, and it can be called on any string as if it were an instance method.

In summary, the key differences are:

- **Instance Method:** Associated with an instance of a class, operates on that instance, and can access instance members.

- **Extension Method:** A special kind of static method that allows you to add methods to existing types, defined in a static class, and called as if they were instance methods on the extended type.
