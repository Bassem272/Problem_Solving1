It seems like there might be a typo in your response, but I'll assume you're referring to the mention of "const object (or const reference)" in the context of C++.

In C++, the `const` qualifier can be applied to objects and references, and it serves to indicate that the object (or the object referenced) should not be modified. Here's a brief explanation of the two scenarios:

1. **Const Object:**
   When an object is declared as `const`, it means that the object's value cannot be modified after initialization. For example:
   ```cpp
   const int x = 5;
   // x = 10; // This would result in a compilation error since x is const
   ```

   In the context of your previous code:
   ```cpp
   const TestStruct two;
   ```

   `two` is a const object of type `TestStruct`, and any attempt to modify it will result in a compilation error.

2. **Const Reference:**
   When a reference is declared as `const`, it means that through that reference, you cannot modify the underlying object. For example:
   ```cpp
   int y = 10;
   const int& refY = y;
   // refY = 5; // This would result in a compilation error since refY is const
   ```

   In the context of your previous code:
   ```cpp
   void function2(const TestStruct & a)
   ```

   The function `function2` takes a const reference to a `TestStruct` object. This means that within the function, you can only call const-qualified member functions on the object passed as an argument, and you cannot modify the object itself.

The use of `const` in C++ is beneficial for several reasons:
- It helps in writing more robust and maintainable code by preventing accidental modifications of values.
- It provides additional information to the compiler and other developers about the intended usage of variables and functions.
- It allows optimizations by the compiler since it knows that certain values will not change.
