The performance drawbacks for each data structure in this scenario are as follows:

1. **std::vector:**
   - **Drawbacks: Slow removal and slow query**
   - Explanation: Removing an item from the middle of a vector involves shifting all elements after the removed one, resulting in slow removal. Querying for the heaviest item requires linear search, making it slow.

2. **std::list:**
   - **Drawbacks: Slow query**
   - Explanation: While removal from a list is more efficient than a vector, querying for the heaviest item still involves traversing the list, leading to slow queries.

3. **std::unordered_set:**
   - **Drawbacks: Slow query**
   - Explanation: Unordered sets are optimized for constant-time average-case complexity for lookup operations (like find), but finding the heaviest item involves iterating through all items, resulting in slow queries.

4. **std::set:**
   - **Drawbacks: None**
   - Explanation: Sets (implemented as binary search trees, usually red-black trees) provide logarithmic time complexity for both removal and finding the heaviest item. This makes them efficient for this scenario.

Given the above, the correct option is:

**1) slow removal, 2) slow query, 3) slow query, 4) none**
